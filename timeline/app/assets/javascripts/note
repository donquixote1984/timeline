So how to locate the fuckin center node when dragging?
A fully scan is most safe and slow, and will be calculate every dragging. dangerous for thousands of nodes.

Every dragging event will generate one variable:

clientX

every time record the previous clientX and get the new clientX. 

the distance between the 2 clientX is the offset of every dragging.

just use this offset.

suppose the current center node is N1, current positon is N1->p

the left positon is N1->l  the right position is N1->r

if offset > 0 

current positon is : N1->p + offset 

if N1->p > N1->right . //change the center node to N2
	relocate right 10 nodes

else  //offset< 0

current position is : N1->p + offset

if N1->p < N1->left  change the center node to N0
	relocate left 10 nodes

Damn.
